However, by doing that you inherit bias in those assumptions. You make decisions that don&rsquo;t hold true, and at best you are likely going to make poor decisions, and at worst create an exclusionary environment &ndash; locking out people who you will want to include.</p><p>If you believe it is Common Sense, prove it is Common Sense. Test it out. Trial it, and properly. Don&rsquo;t be part of the problem.</p><p>Also, challenge &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo; when it is used.</p><blockquote><p>Why is it common sense?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Who else thinks they know that as the answer?</p></blockquote><p>You should end up with a better solution that is more open and equitable than your assumptions.</p></article></li><li class=post><article class=post__header><header class=post__header><h2 class=post__title><a href=/blog/assessing-security-practices-of-3rd-party-projects/>Assessing Security Practices of 3rd Party products</a></h2></header><time class=post__date datetime="2020-11-20 18:10:32 +0100 +0100">Nov 20 2020</time><p>In recent months I&rsquo;ve been involved in discussions about whether remote working tools are &ldquo;secure&rdquo; or not. The answer to any blunt question like that is, as always, &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;, but this is as helpful as getting financial advice from YouTube adverts.</p><p>It struck me that a lot of people interested in IT security often judge tools based upon how many vulnerabilities there are in a product. But lets be accurate here, they are judging it on how many security vulnerabilities are reported, or visible.</p><p>Once the pandemic forced us all to work from home, <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52115434>Zoom seemed to be the target for every &ldquo;white hat&rdquo; hacker consultancy</a> <em>generously</em> giving their time to declare the 0 days they found to news websites, with nothing more in return than their company name to be placed along side the <del>advert</del> article.</p><p>These articles seemingly leading to several instances of &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; security teams declaring Zoom as insecure and made attempts to block its usage in their environments.</p><p>But is Zoom unsecure? And does blocking it improve things?</p><p>If you block Zoom, what will people use instead? Google Hangout? Skype? Chime? WebEx? Some random tool they found on the internet? Is blocking Zoom making things more or less secure?</p><p>Zoom got the attention because its user base and visibility increased massively during the pandemic. Admittedly it did have some low hanging fruit, but was it more or less of a threat to a business than your employees using something like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegle>Omegle</a> for work?</p><p>If we used the same metrics in which we judge Zoom and apply it to Windows or Linux those security teams would block almost all operating systems out there except maybe OpenBSD and BeOS.</p><h2 id=it-security-shouldnt-be-reactionary>IT security shouldn&rsquo;t be reactionary<a class=anchor href=#it-security-shouldnt-be-reactionary>#</a></h2><p>IT security needs to be evidence lead. Would you say now that Zoom, after 6 months of global usage it is not secure? Other than the occasional <a href=https://twitter.com/mvanhulten/status/1329885925862760450>person posting their Zoom codes</a>, which is the Video Conferencing equivalent of calling your S3 bucket <code>big-bank-data</code>.</p><p>So can how can we be less reactionary in future?</p><p>One thing is to <a href=https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/03/zoom_security_improvements/>recognise that Zoom fixed a lot</a>, if not all, the issues that the security researchers were making a fuss over. Usually within days or weeks.</p><p>Where-as shouldn&rsquo;t we <a href=https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-github-times-up-this-unfixed-high-severity-security-bug-affects-developers/>trust GitHub less</a> for having a long standing issue it&rsquo;s been unable or unwilling to fix?</p><p>What I&rsquo;m proposing is instead of making decisions based upon what we read in the tech news this week, we measure good security practice from 3rd parties on how quickly and responsibly vulnerabilities in their products are announced and fixed, and be pragmatic about what your users need and expect from their IT.</p></article></li></ul><ul class=tags__list></ul></div></div></main><script src=/js/index.min.49e4d8a384357d9b445b87371863419937ede9fa77737522ffb633073aebfa44.js integrity="sha256-SeTYo4Q1fZtEW4c3GGNBmTft6fp3c3Ui/7YzBzrr+kQ=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
