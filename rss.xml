This recent post &lt;a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/should-your-team-adopt-no-meeting-weeks">&amp;ldquo;Should Your Team Adopt No-Meeting Weeks&amp;rdquo; really resonated with me&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore of-course-->
&lt;p>I read an article while back, but of course I cannot find now, about how you might want to consider applying &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering">Chaos Engineering&lt;/a>, not only to your technology, but also your people. A random person gets selected maybe once a week, to take the day off. Simulating a sick-leave like situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge proponent of the idea that no single person should be critical to your business, and in fact they become a massive risk to your business that is only realised once they leave. It also creates an uncollaborative working environment because you will have a lot of different pressures from different people on one person. This is covered a lot in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO">The Phoenix Project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the principles behind Chaos Engineering you can build in expectations in to your team that you should be able to survive the loss of a person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I like with the experiment mentioned in the post, taking a random person out of meetings, was that this it is similar to Chaos Engineering your team, but at a smaller scale. In the situation where the person, who is critical to your meeting, gets unceremoniously booted out of said meeting, you have identified a process that doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for the loss of one person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other issue is that if people learn they&amp;rsquo;re not necessary for a meeting they stop coming, which I assume is the intention. However now, you start kicking out important people from the meeting, such as the executive authoriser who was there specifically for that meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the post these issues was explained as the experiment failing. I would look at it from the other direction, it&amp;rsquo;s a failing of the processes to have a dependency in a single person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As CGP Grey often says, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/boezS4C_MFc">one is none&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you need two (or more) executives in the meeting. I&amp;rsquo;m taking the broader picture. Does everyone really need to be in the same room at the same time? In my experience I would say 90% of the time the answer is no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead the major discussions should happen before the meeting, on your preferred collaboration tool. Any reading material can be distributed before hand and consumed at your leisure. If someone has a vested interest, such as an executive authoriser, they can raise any concerns before anyone steps in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meeting becomes a formality to say &amp;ldquo;a decision needs to be made by this date and time&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s more like that cliche moment in weddings in movies where the vicar says &amp;ldquo;Speak now or forever hold your piece&amp;rdquo;. The meeting should be 5 minutes tops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only other time people might want to meet at the same time is if something was being presented, such as a town hall or a sprint review. In those situations you should ensure that those meetings are recorded and published so that others can view and ask questions later if they were interested, but weren&amp;rsquo;t able to attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leaves everyone free to work on what&amp;rsquo;s important, when it&amp;rsquo;s important. Not spending their entire day in meetings being presented material they could have accessed at any time. Or using time less efficiently because they&amp;rsquo;re winding up to a meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, as the original post admits, this may only work in a Google-eque business process utopia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CharDiff</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/chardiff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 10:24:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/chardiff/</guid><description>&lt;p>CharDiff is an easy-to-use tool to compare 2 strings and highlight the characters in them that are different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This came about for a couple reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one I had some very long strings I was working with at the time and I was having a lot of difficulty finding where they differed. I really struggled to find any tools that would allow me to find the difference between strings at a character level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other reason was I was looking for a very quick project in Python3 that I could use to do things properly. By which I mean, have tested code, have it running in a CI/CD pipeline (I wanted to play with the GitHub Actions beta I&amp;rsquo;d got myself on to) and have it publish to PyPI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I even already have some &lt;a href="https://github.com/yamatt/python3-chardiff/issues/2">nice feedback from some users&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have seen subsequent posts around the web of tools like this, and there are &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannhof/difference.rs">definitely better ones out there&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be the best but to expand my knowledge. I now have a template for future projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TV Show Chart</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/tv-show-chart/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 17:14:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/tv-show-chart/</guid><description>&lt;p>There used to be a website that did this for you. It seemed to go away. So I decided to write some quick hacks to make my own. It is really bare minimum to get it working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started off being nothing good or professional about the code behind the repo. I am not a front-end person at all, other than I like doing a bit of JavaScript from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I personally prefer the IMDb popularity scores, but their API is functionally non-existent. So I wrote some Python to pull all the code together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally my plan was to store the episode data objects in maybe S3 or B2 and process the data in AWS Lambdas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However I could never get the Lambdas to complete in time and I was worried if the site became popular I would be paying for bandwidth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then realised I might be able to store the data in GitHub, but the data as JSON was far too big. I seem to remember reading that there is a 2Gb limit on GitHub repo sizes. So I created my own proprietary format to store the data in a more succinct way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with static sites in GitHub and these work really well with GitHub Actions, commiting the code back to the repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus I read an article about grabbing &lt;a href="https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/">Covid data using GitHub Actions on a schedule&lt;/a>. It really made me want to revisit this work since the data hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also found that GitHub Actions are way more powerful that Lambdas so I could run the scripts in a matter of minutes, which was nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are definitely some UX improvements I would like to make so it&amp;rsquo;s possible to search for TV shows, but I need to do a bit of professionalisation first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter Annoyances</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/filter-annoyances/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:14:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/showcase/filter-annoyances/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my first foray in to making uBlock origin. I was at the time, and still do, wanted to remove the cookie and GDPR pop-ups but still use the site. These filters help facilitate that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a couple of built-in ones to uBlock such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist">easylist cookie&lt;/a> and uBlock Annoyances, but these looked difficult to contribute to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did use &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/">&lt;em>I don&amp;rsquo;t care about cookies&lt;/em>&lt;/a> for a little while, which worked fine, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;rsquo;s source code anywhere, despite it saying it&amp;rsquo;s open source. So I thought to be safe I would stop using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m kind of curious about ways you can test and validate uBlock Origin filters. It seems kind of difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also found that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax">filter syntax used in uBlock Origin comes from Adblock Plus&lt;/a>, and they can be very imprecise. But the uBlock Origin element picker tool is amazing. Some of the time I use it then copy the generated rule in to this repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose (rather unusually for me) the CC0 license for these filters because I wanted to put them as much in to the public domain as possible, and because they are not really programmatic scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The distractions list is purely for things that take me away being productive on sites I use day-to-day. Kind of dark patterns really that keep you on their site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aggressive filter I&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from because it was too difficult to maintain and I kept having to switch off uBlock to see if the page worked, which then meant I saw ads.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Common Sense as Bad Practice</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/common-sense-as-bad-practice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 13:35:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/common-sense-as-bad-practice/</guid><description>&lt;p>It came to me in conversation recently as to how toxic &amp;ldquo;Common Sense&amp;rdquo; is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Common Sense says &amp;ldquo;well, everyone uses X, so we should use X&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Everyone should know this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But those are fallacies and assumptions that aren&amp;rsquo;t tested or rooted in evidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually Common Sense comes from asking your mates or colleagues, or assuming they think the same as you. However, by doing that you inherit bias in those assumptions. You make decisions that don&amp;rsquo;t hold true, and at best you are likely going to make poor decisions, and at worst create an exclusionary environment &amp;ndash; locking out people who you will want to include.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you believe it is Common Sense, prove it is Common Sense. Test it out. Trial it, and properly. Don&amp;rsquo;t be part of the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, challenge &amp;ldquo;Common Sense&amp;rdquo; when it is used.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why is it common sense?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Who else thinks they know that as the answer?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You should end up with a better solution that is more open and equitable than your assumptions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing Security Practices of 3rd Party products</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/assessing-security-practices-of-3rd-party-projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 18:10:32 +0100</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/blog/assessing-security-practices-of-3rd-party-projects/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent months I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in discussions about whether remote working tools are &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; or not. The answer to any blunt question like that is, as always, &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;, but this is as helpful as getting financial advice from YouTube adverts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It struck me that a lot of people interested in IT security often judge tools based upon how many vulnerabilities there are in a product. But lets be accurate here, they are judging it on how many security vulnerabilities are reported, or visible.&lt;/p>
&lt;!--alex ignore white-->
&lt;p>Once the pandemic forced us all to work from home, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52115434">Zoom seemed to be the target for every &amp;ldquo;white hat&amp;rdquo; hacker consultancy&lt;/a> &lt;em>generously&lt;/em> giving their time to declare the 0 days they found to news websites, with nothing more in return than their company name to be placed along side the &lt;del>advert&lt;/del> article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These articles seemingly leading to several instances of &amp;ldquo;Enterprise&amp;rdquo; security teams declaring Zoom as insecure and made attempts to block its usage in their environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But is Zoom unsecure? And does blocking it improve things?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you block Zoom, what will people use instead? Google Hangout? Skype? Chime? WebEx? Some random tool they found on the internet? Is blocking Zoom making things more or less secure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zoom got the attention because its user base and visibility increased massively during the pandemic. Admittedly it did have some low hanging fruit, but was it more or less of a threat to a business than your employees using something like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omegle">Omegle&lt;/a> for work?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we used the same metrics in which we judge Zoom and apply it to Windows or Linux those security teams would block almost all operating systems out there except maybe OpenBSD and BeOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-security-shouldnt-be-reactionary">IT security shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be reactionary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IT security needs to be evidence lead. Would you say now that Zoom, after 6 months of global usage it is not secure? Other than the occasional &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mvanhulten/status/1329885925862760450">person posting their Zoom codes&lt;/a>, which is the Video Conferencing equivalent of calling your S3 bucket &lt;code>big-bank-data&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So can how can we be less reactionary in future?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing is to &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/03/zoom_security_improvements/">recognise that Zoom fixed a lot&lt;/a>, if not all, the issues that the security researchers were making a fuss over. Usually within days or weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where-as shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-github-times-up-this-unfixed-high-severity-security-bug-affects-developers/">trust GitHub less&lt;/a> for having a long standing issue it&amp;rsquo;s been unable or unwilling to fix?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I&amp;rsquo;m proposing is instead of making decisions based upon what we read in the tech news this week, we measure good security practice from 3rd parties on how quickly and responsibly vulnerabilities in their products are announced and fixed, and be pragmatic about what your users need and expect from their IT.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://matt.copperwaite.net/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>matt@copperwaite.net (Matt Copperwaite)</author><guid>https://matt.copperwaite.net/about-me/</guid><description>&lt;!--alex ignore servant-->
