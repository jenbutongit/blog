I was at the time, and still do, wanted to remove the cookie and GDPR pop-ups but still use the site. These filters help facilitate that.</p><p>There are a couple of built-in ones to uBlock such as <a href=https://github.com/easylist/easylist>easylist cookie</a> and uBlock Annoyances, but these looked difficult to contribute to.</p><p>I did use <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/><em>I don&rsquo;t care about cookies</em></a> for a little while, which worked fine, but I couldn&rsquo;t find it&rsquo;s source code anywhere, despite it saying it&rsquo;s open source. So I thought to be safe I would stop using it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m kind of curious about ways you can test and validate uBlock Origin filters. It seems kind of difficult.</p><p>I also found that the <a href=https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax>filter syntax used in uBlock Origin comes from Adblock Plus</a>, and they can be very imprecise. But the uBlock Origin element picker tool is amazing. Some of the time I use it then copy the generated rule in to this repo.</p><p>I chose (rather unusually for me) the CC0 license for these filters because I wanted to put them as much in to the public domain as possible, and because they are not really programmatic scripts.</p><p>The distractions list is purely for things that take me away being productive on sites I use day-to-day. Kind of dark patterns really that keep you on their site.</p><p>The aggressive filter I&rsquo;ve moved away from because it was too difficult to maintain and I kept having to switch off uBlock to see if the page worked, which then meant I saw adds.</p></article></li></ul><ul class=tags__list></ul></div></div></main><script src=/js/index.min.49e4d8a384357d9b445b87371863419937ede9fa77737522ffb633073aebfa44.js integrity="sha256-SeTYo4Q1fZtEW4c3GGNBmTft6fp3c3Ui/7YzBzrr+kQ=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
