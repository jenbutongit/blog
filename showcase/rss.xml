I was at the time, and still do, wanted to remove the cookie and GDPR pop-ups but still use the site. These filters help facilitate that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a couple of built-in ones to uBlock such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist">easylist cookie&lt;/a> and uBlock Annoyances, but these looked difficult to contribute to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did use &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/">&lt;em>I don&amp;rsquo;t care about cookies&lt;/em>&lt;/a> for a little while, which worked fine, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it&amp;rsquo;s source code anywhere, despite it saying it&amp;rsquo;s open source. So I thought to be safe I would stop using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m kind of curious about ways you can test and validate uBlock Origin filters. It seems kind of difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also found that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax">filter syntax used in uBlock Origin comes from Adblock Plus&lt;/a>, and they can be very imprecise. But the uBlock Origin element picker tool is amazing. Some of the time I use it then copy the generated rule in to this repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose (rather unusually for me) the CC0 license for these filters because I wanted to put them as much in to the public domain as possible, and because they are not really programmatic scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The distractions list is purely for things that take me away being productive on sites I use day-to-day. Kind of dark patterns really that keep you on their site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aggressive filter I&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from because it was too difficult to maintain and I kept having to switch off uBlock to see if the page worked, which then meant I saw adds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
