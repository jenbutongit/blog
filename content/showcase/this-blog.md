[This blog](https://matt.copperwaite.net) is my attempt as consolidating my IT security knowledge using Agile methodology.

I had a couple of requirements:

* Cost sensitive - When it comes to personal projects I try to be very cost sensitive
* No Analytics - I appreciate it if people read my blog, but I'm mainly writing for myself. I don't care in detail who reads it or how they interact with it.
* Minimal bandwidth costs - I don't want this blog to go down if I have the fortunate problem of becoming popular
* Static site - I knew I wanted to play with a static site generator
* Use of Content linting tools - I wanted to ensure the quality of the content of my blog by using a pipeline that measured content quality.

I really enjoy this sort of thinking. It left me with a couple of options. My first thought was a public S3 bucket, but after a lot of thinking I realised the tool that filled all of these options was GitHub Pages.

Now GitHub Pages does have it's own static page generator, but after a bit of searching I settled on Hugo having the most widely used and best documentation. I also found a GitHub Action that could automatically build Hugo sites which saved me a lot of time.

That is not to say my journey in to Hugo was easy, things like using submodules in git makes me squirm, but I'm super happy with the results. I've also set it up in a way which means if I wanted to set up other blogs it would be very little effort to get it going.

## Content Quality

I used to have (or more accurately abandoned) a Twitter account, but after seeing the Twitter backlash one of the things that concerns me is my ability to explain complex problems in a concise way. A blog was the obvious answer to me. I read a lot of blog posts via [lobste.rs](https://losbte.rs) (there's a whole separate post required about why I don't read Hacker News) I also wanted to be as inclusive as possible in my writing and bringing in content quality tooling in much the same way you would bring in linters and tests to bring in code quality, seemed the best way of doing that.

After some discussions with colleagues I gathered some tooling that I wanted to incline in a CI/CD pipeline. I don't think this is the extent of tools that could be included but enough tooling to make me comfortable with writing a blog.

### AlexJS

Using GitHub Actions allowed me to inline the assessment of the quality of my content. One of the tools I chose was [AlexJS](https://alexjs.com/). I was already a little familiar with it anyway, having been referred it by a friend. AlexJS that looks to improve the equality in your use of language and is super cool and it's been fascinating how it's been teaching me to adapt my language. I looked for similar products that I could also include, but I wasn't very successful.

### Make words better

Another things I did want to include was something like Grammarly to improve the understanding of the content, however as it was not open source and the API didn't seem to meet what I wanted to do I discovered GrammarBot. It still didn't integrate nicely with CI/CD pipelines, so [I wrote a wrapper](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-hemoglobin) to print human readable results.

### Reading complexity and length

The other thing I wanted to do to improve content quality was to ensure my use of language was not too complex and that the reading length is not too long. I really struggled to find many tools here. There one I found is a Python library called textstat, which reads plain text files and derives lots of stats about complexity. I haven't taken the time to study in detail what the numbers mean, but I figured if the numbers were at least reasonably consistent I'm probably doing ok.

However since textstat is a library I needed to [write a wrapper](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-textstat-cli) that allowed it to be included in a CI/CD pipeline and be human readable.

One of the other things I wanted to do was to ensure the reading length of the text was no more than 10 minutes. I use Firefox's Reader view quite a lot. At the top it gives you an approximate reading time. My upper bound on that is 10 minutes. It's partly a free time thing, but also I feel like if you can't explain a problem within a reasonable time-frame you either needed to break it out in to separate posts, or you're not very effective at explaining a problem.

This reading length requirement is actually a really simple bit of maths to detect the number of words and then divide that by a variety of people's reading speeds. It was so quick to do I actually bundled it in to [textstat-cli](https://github.com/yamatt/python3-textstat-cli).

## Future

## Stats

One day, once I get enough posts together I will try to see what interesting stats I can find. Since I'm not using analytics I'll never be able to do that end of year blog post that my favourite blog posts do that usually discuss their most popular blog posts. But perhaps for me that will be the time I do my stats reviews.

## Comments on Posts

I did want to include comments on blog posts as a proxy for page impressions and to improve engagement. I played with using GitHub Issues as comments and as you might expect I'm [far from alone](https://github.com/krasimir/octomments) in that. However I am yet to have the time to include it.
