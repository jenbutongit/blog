Back in 2015 I co-authored a book on [Learning the Flask Framework](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Flask-Framework-data-driven-applications/dp/1783983361) on the subject of creating a website using the utterly brilliant [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) framework in Python.

In the book I discuss the process of building a blog in Flask. Starting with the how to get started and moving on to forms and working with databases. As with any technology book its age it could be considered dated now, the world has moved on in those years and it's not  I would recommend following now, but if you want to get familiar with Flask there are few books as comprehensive as this one.

 It was an experiment to see what the authoring process was like and it was far more difficult and more intensive than I had expected. I was even working on it the day before I got married. It's not something I care to repeat.

I much prefer open and public documentation. But I am pleased with and proud of the book.
