I started on a new project recently that was building out in to a reasonably immature [Landing Zone](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/)-like platform. After a lot of back and forth during our initial assessment phase we discovered that while there was a lot of documents and processes, none of them were unified, or leant themselves to DevOps or SRE development best practice.

Given this the approach we took was to deliver the easiest possible "Hello World" web service within our first sprint. Something realistic, but not earth shattering. We wanted to keep the technical challenges to a minimum, and instead use the sprint as a way of identifying business processes that were going have to work with on our journey.

This would then allow us to be realistic with our users about the time frames from getting from nothing to something.

I hadn't heard the term before, but this Sprint 0 we decided to called Rapid Assumption Testing (or RAT), because we wanted to understand ours (and the businesses) assumptions as quickly as possible without bogging ourselves down in to technical detail early.

By the end of the sprint we hadn't actually delivered a product to users. We had a working Hello World, but not something users could readily access. However that was the point. It wasn't to challenge ourselves, but to challenge the business in to providing us the roadmap to that delivered product. Instead we felt confident that we were had an outline of the teams, gates, and documentation we needed to work within.

That also gave us the opportunity to document the process to share with future teams, to help increase their velocity, and will help us make contacts with other projects, sharing knowledge, ideas and people. We can also use all of that to form a cabal of delivery teams with the aim of influencing the process to make it more Agile.

As you might expect the Sprint didn't go entirely smoothly. We were open with the business that what we weren't delivering wasn't anything of any immediate value and we were subsequently offered (more than once) to shortcut the normal process. As this wouldn't have helped identify the process so we turned those offers down whenever they arose, but it did set us back to end up in those discussions.

There is also an interesting discussion at this point that once we get our foot in the door, whats to stop us building out from there, with less oversight. The gatekeepers took our word that this was a basic app. But how do they know that?

Anyway, for Sprint 1 we decided to run roughly the same tasks again but expand on the "Hello World" to something meaningful and tangible so those shortcuts that we were less likely to be offered.

In retrospect I would have attempted something more substantial first. I wouldn't say it got us any further along, but it might have tightened up the focus of the conversations.
