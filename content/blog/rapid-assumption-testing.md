I started on a new project recently that was building out in to a compartment of a reasonably immature [Landing Zone](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/)-like cloud platform. After a lot of back and forth during our initial process discovery phase we found that while there was a lot of documents and processes, none of them were unified, or leant themselves to DevOps or SRE development best practice.

Given this, the approach we took was to deliver the easiest possible "Hello World" web service within our first sprint. The value was low, but we knew that by keeping our technical challenges well defined and to a minimum we instead were able to use the sprint as a way to test against the business processes that did exist to uncover the bumps that were going have to work with on our journey.

This would then allow us to be realistic with our users in future about the time frames of getting from nothing to something.

I hadn't heard the term before, but this Sprint 0 we decided to called Rapid Assumption Testing (or RAT), because we wanted to understand ours (and the businesses) assumptions as quickly as possible without bogging ourselves down in to technical detail early.

By the end of the sprint we hadn't actually delivered a product to users. We had a working Hello World, but not something users could readily access. However that was part of the point. It wasn't to challenge ourselves, but to challenge the business in to providing us the roadmap that any future delivery would have to work against. By completing this sprint we felt confident that we had a good understanding of the teams, gates, and documentation we needed to work with.

That also gave us the opportunity to document the process so it could be shared with any teams in a similar position in future, helping to increase their velocity. In return it will allow us make contacts with other projects, sharing knowledge, ideas and people, with the aim to minimize duplication and have a community to call upon and support us. E eventually perhaps influence the business processes through one voice.

As you might expect the Sprint didn't go entirely smoothly. We were open with the business that what we were delivering wasn't anything of any immediate value and we were subsequently offered (more than once) to shortcut the normal process. As this wouldn't have helped identify our assumptions about the process we turned those offers down whenever they arose, but it mean we went down assumption cul-de-sacs.

Anyway, for Sprint 1 we decided to run roughly the same tasks again but expand on the "Hello World" to something meaningful and tangible so that we weren't offered those shortcuts and help us identify more assumptions.

In retrospect I would have attempted something more substantial first. I wouldn't say it got us any further along, but it might have tightened up the focus of the conversations.
