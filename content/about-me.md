Hi, I'm Matt Copperwaite. I've worked for the United Kingdom Government for over 10 years both as a contractor and as a Civil Servant.

I started off as a Software Engineer, but got heavily involved in IT infrastructure projects and am now specialising in applying IT security to projects using Agile techniques.
